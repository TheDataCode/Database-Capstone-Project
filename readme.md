## Lemon Restaurant Data Modelling and Analysis Project
The project involves the implementation of a database with relationships, inserted values, and procedural and transactional use cases, with a focus on practical application.   
Moreover, it incorporates data analysis techniques to gain insights and guide decision-making.<br>                                                                                                                   
The database is created to store and manage data efficiently with optimised queries. The procedural and transactional implementations guarantee data consistency and integrity. <br><br><br><br>

    #### Stored Procedures with Transactions.                                                                                       
    Using stored procedures with transactions in databases provides a structured and controlled approach to database operations, ensuring    data integrity, consistency, and security while promoting code reusability and performance optimisation.

 - ### Prepared Statement
  prepared statements in MySQL offer performance optimisation, protection against SQL injection attacks, increased security, improved       code maintainability and readability, and database portability. They are an essential tool for building secure, efficient, and           maintainable database-driven applications.
