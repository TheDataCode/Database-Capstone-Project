## Lemon Restaurant Data Modelling and Analysis Project
This project is a database implementation with relationships, inserted values, and procedural and transactional code. It showcases my skills in database design and programming with a focus on practical applications.                                                       
Additionally, it incorporates data analysis techniques to gain insights and inform decision-making.                                         
The database is designed to efficiently store and manage data with optimized queries, and the procedural and transactional code ensures data integrity and consistency.                                                                                                    
It is a practical demonstration of my proficiency in SQL and my capacity to develop and maintain a comprehensive database system for real-world use.
